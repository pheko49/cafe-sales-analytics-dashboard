## 🧠 Executive Summary

The café’s sales data was analyzed to understand customer spending habits, product performance, and payment preferences across multiple locations and time periods.  
Findings reveal consistent sales across product categories, steady monthly growth, and a balanced distribution of payment methods.  

The data shows that while beverages remain the café’s most consistent revenue drivers, other items such as sandwiches and baked goods also contribute significantly, indicating a well-rounded product mix.

## 🔎 Insights Deep Dive

### ☕ Product Insights
- **Top-performing items:** Coffee, Sandwiches, and Smoothies contribute most to total revenue.  
- **Lower-performing items:** Cookies and Cakes show moderate but stable sales trends.  
- Seasonal variation appears in beverage sales, with slight increases during warmer months.

### 💳 Payment Method Trends
- Usage across **Digital Wallet (33.6%)**, **Credit Card (33.2%)**, and **Cash (33.2%)** is nearly **equal**.  
- This even split indicates that the café caters to a wide range of customers — from digital-first to cash-based buyers.  
- Encouraging **Digital Wallet adoption** through loyalty rewards could reduce cash handling and speed up transactions.

### 📅 Transaction Trends
- Monthly sales trends show stable revenue with slight fluctuations that may reflect seasonality or promotional campaigns.  
- Most purchases occur **in-store**, with **takeaway sales** showing room for growth through online ordering or delivery options.

### 📍 Location Insights
- Analysis of sales by order type shows a 50/50 split between Takeaway and In-Store purchases. This highlights that customer demand is equally strong across both service channels, suggesting flexibility in how customers engage with the café.

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Encourage Digital Payment Adoption**  
   - Introduce small discounts or loyalty points for Digital Wallet users to simplify transactions.  

2. **Boost Low-performing Items**  
   - Promote items like cookies and cakes through combo deals (e.g., “Coffee + Cake Special”).  

3. **Leverage Seasonal Patterns**  
   - Plan promotions around high-selling months and introduce limited-time seasonal beverages.  

4. **Enhance Dashboard Interactivity**  
   - Add filters for item type, payment method, and location.  
   - Incorporate tooltips and drilldowns for transaction-level insights.  

5. **Expand Data Tracking**  
   - Integrate customer-level metrics (frequency, average spend) for deeper behavior analysis.
