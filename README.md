Interactive café sales dashboard built with Python, Plotly and Dash


# ☕ Café Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project explores and visualizes café sales data using **Python**, focusing on building an **interactive dashboard** with **Plotly** and **Dash**.

It covers the full data analytics workflow — from **ETL** (Extract, Transform, Load) and **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis) to creating dynamic, interactive visualizations.

## 🚧 Project Status: *Work in Progress*

This dashboard is currently under active development.  
I'm refining the **layout, interactivity, and visuals** to make it more insightful and user-friendly.

Planned improvements:
- Enhanced dashboard layout and style  
- Additional KPIs (average transaction size, category-level trends)  
- Integration of dynamic date filters and summary cards  
- Option to auto-refresh or pull new data

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze café sales data to understand:
- Which products drive the most revenue  
- Sales patterns over time (daily, weekly, monthly)  
- Payment method trends  
- In-store vs takeaway performance  

The final dashboard provides interactive, real-time insights for better business decision-making.
